Abstract of Project Work

Italian territory is well known for being so historic and colourful and it deserves to be
described and valued by citizens and visitors. But local councils who largely bear the
effort of collecting data do not achieve the final objective to produce useful results for
interested people. Consequently, Italian population and foreigners are not aware of the
potentiality of the geographic area and miss a clear understanding of the impacting
indicators for society. This study aims at preparing visual outputs about ecosystem and
infrastructure indicators of high relevance for any user who wants to know better its
community and the area of residence. A Choropleth map will be used together with
module Plotly and Geojson regions/provinces file for a quantitative measure of high and
low rates of a variety of features.
Introduction
A quantitative analysis of social and cultural indicators is one of the most fundamental
requirements for environmental engineers, technicians and consultants planning
environmental studies and research activities for both clients, private and public sector.
The former is represented by private companies that want to explore the surrounding area
before installing and building up an infrastructure, the latter is meant as the government
departments and agencies that ask for environmental studies of indicators for specific
areas which need attention or have a budget to be invested.
In addition, every town council have the responsibility to address the most actual
problems that citizens are forced to face. Residents and visitors miss information about
their local area and find difficulties in selecting the right place where buy or rent a house.
No one has pointed the need of a resident of valuable information about the territory.
Usually estate agencies behave more as businesspeople rather than understating the
real issues and questions of buyers.
A similar question was posted by Ramanickam Srinivasan: “In what ways can citizen
participation contribute to good governance?”1 From his point of view, it seems that “In
large democracies, direct participation of citizens in the governance process poses a big
challenge on account of large populations, even in small pockets. Illiteracy, political
naivety, and insufficient mechanisms to incorporate citizen participation pose further
challenges”1.
With the advent of social networks and technology citizens could participate in the
governance and ask for concise and punctual improvements. Therefore, visual data of
geographic areas is needed for anyone who wants to suggest, ask or comment over an
event or fact. Visual maps that address the structural problems that our society is facing,
that integrate different areas of study and that will be easy to read.
